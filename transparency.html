        <h1>Design Transparency</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: April 26, 2025</em></p>

        <p>InfoSecFor is built on transparency and minimalism. You might have seen the disclaimer on the homepage: “This site influences you – colors, words, design. Question everything!” This page dives into how my design choices might shape your perception underbewusst (a concept called "priming") and invites you to stay critical.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Colors and Their Influence</h2>
            <p>I use a dark color scheme with shades of gray and a teal accent. Here’s how they might shape your perception:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dark Gray (#121212, #1e1e1e, #2a2a2a)</strong> <span style="background-color: #121212; width: 20px; height: 20px; display: inline-block; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;"></span>: These tones feel serious and professional, fitting for InfoSec. They might make you see the site as competent but could feel a bit cold.</li>
                <li><strong>Light Gray Text (#e0e0e0, #777)</strong> <span style="background-color: #e0e0e0; width: 20px; height: 20px; display: inline-block; border: 1px solid #121212;"></span>: High contrast ensures readability and clarity. It aims to be neutral but might seem less emotionally engaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Teal Accent (#00bcd4)</strong> <span style="background-color: #00bcd4; width: 20px; height: 20px; display: inline-block; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;"></span>: Used for links and hover effects, teal suggests trust and tech-savviness. It encourages clicks but subtly guides your focus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: Colors vary across cultures. I chose tones that feel professional globally, but your perception might differ. Try toggling Dark/Light Mode in your browser to feel the difference!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Typography and Familiarity</h2>
            <p>I use 'Segoe UI', a clean, sans-serif font, for its modern look and readability. It’s familiar from tech products like Windows, which might make you feel the site is reliable. But this familiarity could also make you less critical of the content.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Language and Tone</h2>
            <p>My direct tone ("No trackers. No bullshit.") aims to signal honesty and stand out from glossy sites. The homepage disclaimer is part of this – it’s meant to wake you up but might make you trust me more. Phrases like "Let’s keep the internet open, secure, and private" inspire shared values but could make you see the site as morally superior, reducing scrutiny.</p>
            <p>Example: Saying "No trackers" might make you assume the site is 100% data-free, but GitHub Pages collects server logs (see <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Layout and Behavior</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Centered Content (800px)</strong>: Focuses your attention and feels clean, but it might hide that some aspects (e.g., GitHub’s logs) are outside my control.</li>
                <li><strong>Dropdown Menu</strong>: Makes navigation easy but directs you to specific pages (e.g., "Projects").</li>
                <li><strong>Open-Source Content</strong>: Free tools or code might make you feel inclined to engage (e.g., star the repo), even if I don’t ask for it.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. The Meta-Problem: Transparency as Priming</h2>
            <p>By explaining these effects, including the homepage disclaimer, I aim to be open – but this page itself could make you trust the site more than you otherwise would. It’s not a trick; it’s just how communication works. I encourage you to question everything, including this page.</p>
            <p>Tip: Notice if the teal links make you want to click faster, or if the minimalist design feels "too clean." That’s priming in action.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Commitment to Fairness</h2>
            <p>I avoid manipulative tactics like urgent CTAs ("Act now!"), ads, or trackers. My goal is to share InfoSec and OSINT knowledge without compromising your autonomy. If you spot influences I missed, open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/SilverHaze99/SilverHaze99.github.io">GitHub</a> or start a discussion!</p>
