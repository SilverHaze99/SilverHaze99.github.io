   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>Yo, I’m <strong>Silver</strong>, a 25-year-old tech junkie from Austria, neck-deep in <strong>Local AI</strong>, <strong>OSINT</strong>, <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, and open-source chaos. My goal? To wield tech for innovation, privacy, and the occasional reality check on scammers, all while keeping the internet a freer place.</p>
   <p>I’m a self-taught coder and relentless investigator, hooked on building smart systems and digging up hidden data trails. From running AI models locally for max privacy to mapping phishing networks across borders, I’m all about learning, creating, and collaborating. My vibe is a mix of curiosity, minimalism, and a knack for uncovering what others miss.</p>
   <p><strong>What’s on My Plate:</strong></p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Local AI</strong>: Tweaking AI models for efficiency and privacy, with a dash of multi-model mayhem.</li>
      <li><strong>OSINT</strong>: Scraping public data to expose scams and track cyber threats like a digital detective.</li>
      <li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: Chasing down credential leaks, reporting bad actors, and mastering the art of proper escalation (no more Twitter rants).</li>
      <li><strong>Code</strong>: Rocking Python, Bash, and PowerShell, with Rust on my radar for high-performance projects.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Level up my AI optimization skills, contribute to open-source AI and OSINT projects, and team up with devs and researchers—newbies or veterans. I’m crafting beginner-friendly OSINT tools and AI-driven security utils to make the internet a tougher place for cybercriminals.</p>
   <p><strong>Toolkit:</strong> Python, Bash, PowerShell, Git, Docker, Linux, and local AI frameworks. I nerd out with Pandas, TensorFlow, and OSINT analysis tools, all styled with a sleek, teal-tinted, no-nonsense aesthetic.</p>
   <p><strong>Recent Quests:</strong> Tracked international phishing ops, got AI models to throw shade at each other, and learned the hard way that ICANN prefers text files over my 20MB OSINT reports. Oops.</p>
   <p><strong>Let’s Team Up!</strong> Whether you’re just starting out or a cybersecurity pro, I’m down to collaborate on projects that matter. Peek at my GitHub repos, slide into my DMs, or join the convo. Let’s build, learn, and keep the internet legit—together.</p>
