    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: April 22, 2025</em></p>
    
    <p>Welcome to InfoSecFor, a minimalist project showcasing open-source work in <strong>information security</strong>, <strong>privacy</strong>, and <strong>OSINT</strong>. True to our ethosâ€”"No trackers. No bullshit. Just code and plain words"â€”we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how this site handles data, ensuring transparency and respect for your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>This site <strong>does not collect, store, or process any personal data</strong>. Here's what that means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Trackers or Analytics</strong>: We do not use cookies, web beacons, or third-party tracking tools (e.g., Google Analytics).</li>
      <li><strong>No Forms or User Input</strong>: The site has no forms, comment sections, or mechanisms collecting personal information like names, email addresses, or IP addresses.</li>
      <li><strong>Static Content</strong>: Built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages, the site only displays open-source projects and information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This site is hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, a static hosting service by GitHub, Inc. GitHub Pages may collect technical data (e.g., server logs) as part of its operations, which is beyond our control. We chose GitHub Pages for its minimal data practices. See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a> for details.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Other Third Parties</strong>: We do not embed third-party content (e.g., social media widgets, ads) that could track you.</li>
      <li><strong>External Links</strong>: Links to external repositories or resources (e.g., GitHub repos) may appear. These third-party sites have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>As no personal data is collected, there is no data storage or processing to secure. The siteâ€™s content is publicly available, open-source, and hosted securely on GitHub Pages. We take reasonable measures to ensure code and content integrity, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regularly updating dependencies to mitigate security vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>Using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit between your browser and GitHubâ€™s servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since no personal data is collected, there are no personal data rights (e.g., access, deletion, rectification) to exercise. For privacy concerns, contact us (see Section 6).</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in site functionality or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here with a revised "Last Updated" date. As we do not collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly. Please check this page periodically.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For questions, concerns, or suggestions about this Privacy Policy or the siteâ€™s practices, contact us via:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GitHub</strong>: Open an issue on the repository at <a href="https://github.com/SilverHaze99/SilverHaze99.github.io" target="_blank">github.com/SilverHaze99/SilverHaze99.github.io</a> or send a message through GitHub.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Channels</strong>: We keep our digital footprint minimal, so GitHub is the best way to connect.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Commitment to Privacy</h2>
    <p>InfosecFor is a passion project built on <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>minimalism</strong>, and <strong>privacy</strong>. We share knowledge and tools in information security and OSINT without compromising your trust. If you notice anything inconsistent with this commitment, please let us know!</p>
